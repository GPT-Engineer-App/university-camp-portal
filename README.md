# university-camp-portal

I want to create an university orientation camp website, there are sidebar, navbar, main layout.
Vertical Sidebar: allow user to redirect to different page that look like menu component:
""
- overview
"society"
-EXCOs
-Beat/Cheers
"content"
-groups
-rundown
-campfire steps
-sponsorship
"reminder"
-needs
-precaution
"management"
-user groups
--users
--roles
--groups
-settings

the sites under management only can accessed by the admin role

Navbar: allow user to toggle the themes, toggle the language(en to zh), also have an avatar to show a dropdown menu for redirect user to account, and signout button.
